This file is for the risee and fall of games in my school


the first day many game sites were running flawlessly and worked with no problem.


after awhile many sites.google.com appered one including one called novasites
it went in and out of being blocked and developed. 
it was once so popular it had once it 3 working Nebula links to accsess any where beyond the great firewall


then the great downfall began. it only took a week...

day after day things get blocked. Novasites, popular sites, files where getting blocked.

then all of a sudden everthing was blocked. files were not allowed and every 'sites.google.com' were blocked and it all crumbled due to a single kid.
